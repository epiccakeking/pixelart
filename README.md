# Pixelart
Pixel art creation program, written in Go using Fyne.

This is very buggy and can crash. Consider it to be more of a proof of concept.

## Build
I personally recommend using [fyne-cross](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne-cross). Follow the instructions in the fyne-cross repository.

## Controls
May be changed later.

Arrow keys - move cursor

Space - Place pixel

N - Make a new file (currently defaults to 50x50)

Y - Grab pixel under cursor

C - Color picker

O - Open an image

S - Save image
